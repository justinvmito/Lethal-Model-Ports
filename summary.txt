The program works (mostly) as expected. The only errors are minor output formatting errors that were
easily fixed.

The extra credit methods can duplicate and print the llists properly, so they seem to function fine.
The tests can be found as comments in the llist destructor.

I noticed that when you choose the add option, you cannot quit until the user interface does
everything it needs to there. Maybe some way to exit out would be nice, if you were to accidentally
type in a task that you don't want to actually do.
